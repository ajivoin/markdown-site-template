## Customize document appearance with a Bootstrap theme

Bootstrap based Markdown webdocs document can be customized with any Bootstrap compatible theme.
Bootstrap very popular framework, and for it a lot of themes available on the net.

The default template is included only the main bootstrap.css theme file and does not include themes that you see on this site as an example.
If you want to override theme provided by default you can simply overwrite bootstrap.css with file supplied by the theme.

If you plan to use a theme switcher that you need to copy the theme-switcher, and all of the theme folders that you want to use and 
place them in the mods/ folder of the document. Attach theme-switcher by $DOC.mod('theme-switcher'); command.
Edit theme-switcher.js to change the dropdown themes list.
