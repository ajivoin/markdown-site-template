# Components

## Overview

Technically, component Markdown webdocs, it controls in terms controls.js organized into separate modules and provided with additional resources.
In practice, the components of Markdown webdocs, an advanced analog widely used in web design templates.

A component is initially a JavaScript object has parameters, attributes contain data, template function for generate html code and,
of course, those properties and methods that we define in its code.

Certain basic set of ready-made components built into document.js and is available immediately after initialization.
Other components are loaded dynamic or static load scripts on the page.
If a component is not loaded explicitly attempts to automatically download the component from the predefined folder /components.

Elementary components not contain code and style and will not change its behavior and performance.
Complex components can contain code and styles manage their state, behavior and representation and to interact with
document outside world and even mutate other components becoming completely different component.
Autonomous components allow you to completely take out all the dependencies in a separate module.
Versatile components of its habitat is not limited to the browser.
Well-built component may be interpreted on the server and executed in the browser, or to be transferred from one frame to another.
Reliable components are independent of the load order of files on the resources page.
Smart components can cache the data or perform preload. Lazy components do not delay execution of other components.

Example of simple components:

### Hello World!
%highlight#lang=javascript;style=vs((function () {
    function HelloWorldSimplest(parameters, attributes) {
        $ENV.controls.controlInitialize(this, 'hello', parameters, attributes,
            $ENV.default_template, $ENV.default_inner_template);

        this.text('# Hello World!'); // ← Markdown
    };
    HelloWorldSimplest.prototype = $ENV.controls.control_prototype;
    controls.typeRegister('hello', HelloWorldSimplest);
})();
)%highlight

What would be a constructor function has become a component in Markdown webdocs, must meet several conditions:

* In the prototype chain to be controls.control_prototype, it gives a general properties and methods.
* The function must be registered by calling controls.typeRegister() or controls.factoryRegister()
* In the constructor function is required to initiate a call controls.controlInitialize()
* It is desirable to initialize assign specific templates that understand the layout Markdown. $ENV.default_template and $ENV.default_inline_template are such templates that is compatible with Markdown webdocs and can be used in most custom components.

In the example above, only the string %highlight#lang=javascript;style=vs(this.text('# Hello World!');)%highlight is a problem oriented code.

### Manifesto of the component

The component system is based on quite simple, systematic and universal basic principles.

#### Modularity

A component module is a infrastructure. In the same module can be created several components that share data.
The module encapsulates the styles and resources, well-built components should allow control and plug the component resources,
for example to disable unique styles used when the component.

#### Modifications

The main purpose of the parameters - choice of modification of the component.
Modification may be a different view of the same component or may be a separate component.
Parameters are also can be used for passing attribute values​​, where it is convenient.

Examples:
%off(%page-layout#scheme=centered()%page-layout)%off - here is a scheme parameter allows you to choose one or another
modification that for this component selection of the page layout.
%off(%block#$class=m41()%block)%off - this is an example of a atribute passing.

#### Generate HTML code, DOM management, responding to events,
everything is the responsibility of the component, for this basic library provides the appropriate
functionality that reduces the amount of code required. DOM act as visualization tools and fully abstracted from the data objects.
In the simplest case, the developer does not need to do anything , when you create a component already has a default template and appropriate behavior.

#### Arbitrary nesting, fractal, systematic

Each part of the document is similar to the whole document, and can act as a separate document.
Component as part of the document has the same properties.
The document may be part of another documents.

I propose to look through the project site, Section Components, which would have an idea of ​​the capabilities of the components.
